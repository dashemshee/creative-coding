    <title>Emily's emoji</title> 
    <!--
        Use this page to complete the "Emoji" exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1446087/assignments/10969844
    for this assignment I decided to go with the approach of creating my own face emoji rather than using one that already exists. I wanted to play around with the software and try to understand the tools better using creative expression. -->
